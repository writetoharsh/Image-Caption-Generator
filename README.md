# Image-Caption-Generator
Implemented the merge architecture for generating captions from images.

Research Paper implemented - "What is the Role of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in an Image
Caption Generator?" by Marc Tanti, Albert Gatt and Kenneth P. Camilleri.

Dataset used - Flickr8k and some images for test downloaded from Google images.
